- specs for requires API fields etc

## API workflow:

- POST /sources
- POST /sources/:source/pits
- POST /sources/:source/relations

- DELETE /sources means destroying all

Questions for Bert:

- DELETE did not mean ever reference to the carnaval set was removed. Especially relations were kept.
- POSTing new pits has not changed the ids of the carnaval set...

See for instance carnval/28, it was (en still is) Bokkenriek, while it should be Bokkendonk ...???


- Waarom levert zoeken op Teutengat niets op? (carnaval/241) (en zou moeten zijn carnaval/242)
- En zoeken op Toeterland wel?
